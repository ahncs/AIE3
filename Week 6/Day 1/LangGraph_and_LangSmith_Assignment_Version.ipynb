        "\n",

        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-04-01\\nTitle: Bailong: Bilingual Transfer Learning based on QLoRA and Zip-tie Embedding\\nAuthors: Lung-Chuan Chen, Zong-Ru Li\\nSummary: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in\\nvarious NLP applications. However, the majority of existing open-source LLMs\\nare pre-trained primarily on English data and little part of other languages.\\nThis deficiency in multilingual training data results in suboptimal performance\\nwhen applied to languages with fewer available resources. Furthermore,\\nenhancing the performance of LLMs on low-resource languages by full-parameter\\nfine-tuning with additional data requires substantial computational resources,\\nposing computational barriers for research organizations and individual\\nresearchers. Consequently, several techniques such as parameter-efficient\\ntuning and advanced embedding initialization have been proposed to address\\nthese challenges. In this work, we combine them to facilitate cross-lingual\\ntransfer on English-dominated open-source LLM. To effectively enhance the\\nmodel's proficiency in Traditional Chinese, we conduct secondary pre-training\\non Llama 2 7B with Traditional Chinese data by leveraging QLoRA and our\\nproposed zip-tie embedding initialization. The resulting model called Bailong,\\nwhich stands for Bilingual trAnsfer learnIng based on qLOra and zip-tie\\nembeddiNG. We present Bailong-instruct 7B, a fine-tuned version of Bailong 7B\\noptimized for multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Recognizing the inadequacy of\\nbenchmark datasets in Traditional Chinese, we further introduce Bailong-bench\\nto assess the alignment of models with human preferences and the capability to\\nfollow instructions in both Traditional Chinese and English tasks. In our\\nevaluation, Bailong-instruct 7B exhibits competitive performance on\\nBailong-bench and other benchmark datasets when compared to other open-source\\nmodels of similar or even larger parameter sizes.

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-04-01\\nTitle: Bailong: Bilingual Transfer Learning based on QLoRA and Zip-tie Embedding\\nAuthors: Lung-Chuan Chen, Zong-Ru Li\\nSummary: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in\\nvarious NLP applications. However, the majority of existing open-source LLMs\\nare pre-trained primarily on English data and little part of other languages.\\nThis deficiency in multilingual training data results in suboptimal performance\\nwhen applied to languages with fewer available resources. Furthermore,\\nenhancing the performance of LLMs on low-resource languages by full-parameter\\nfine-tuning with additional data requires substantial computational resources,\\nposing computational barriers for research organizations and individual\\nresearchers. Consequently, several techniques such as parameter-efficient\\ntuning and advanced embedding initialization have been proposed to address\\nthese challenges. In this work, we combine them to facilitate cross-lingual\\ntransfer on English-dominated open-source LLM. To effectively enhance the\\nmodel's proficiency in Traditional Chinese, we conduct secondary pre-training\\non Llama 2 7B with Traditional Chinese data by leveraging QLoRA and our\\nproposed zip-tie embedding initialization. The resulting model called Bailong,\\nwhich stands for Bilingual trAnsfer learnIng based on qLOra and zip-tie\\nembeddiNG. We present Bailong-instruct 7B, a fine-tuned version of Bailong 7B\\noptimized for multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Recognizing the inadequacy of\\nbenchmark datasets in Traditional Chinese, we further introduce Bailong-bench\\nto assess the alignment of models with human preferences and the capability to\\nfollow instructions in both Traditional Chinese and English tasks. In our\\nevaluation, Bailong-instruct 7B exhibits competitive performance on\\nBailong-bench and other benchmark datasets when compared to other open-source\\nmodels of similar or even larger parameter sizes.

Here are some significant improvements and benefits that LoRA provides:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for fine-tuning. Instead of updating all the parameters of a large model, LoRA introduces low-rank matrices that adapt the pre-trained model's weights. This makes the fine-tuning process much more parameter-efficient.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA also reduces the memory footprint during training. This is particularly beneficial when working with very large models that would otherwise require substantial computational resources.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: With fewer parameters to update, the training process becomes faster. This can lead to quicker iterations and more rapid experimentation, which is valuable in research and development settings.\\n\\n4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The reduction in computational and memory requirements translates to lower costs for training and deploying models. This makes it more feasible for organizations with limited resources to leverage large language models.\\n\\n5. **Maintaining Performance**: Despite the reduction in parameters, LoRA has been shown to maintain or even improve the performance of the fine-tuned models. This means that the efficiency gains do not come at the cost of model accuracy or effectiveness.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility**: LoRA can be applied to various types of neural network architectures and is not limited to a specific model type. This makes it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.\\n\\n7. **Scalability**: The approach is scalable and can be applied to models of different sizes, making it suitable for both small and large-scale machine learning projects.\\n\\nOverall, LoRA provides a more efficient and cost-effective way to fine-tune large language models without compromising on performance, making it a valuable technique in the field of machine learning.\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 401, 'prompt_tokens': 156, 'total_tokens': 557}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_298125635f', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-30d9aed9-5c39-44a2-aa20-a5dad87745a3-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 156, 'output_tokens': 401, 'total_tokens': 557})]\n",

Here are some significant improvements and benefits that LoRA provides:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for fine-tuning. Instead of updating all the parameters of a large model, LoRA introduces low-rank matrices that adapt the pre-trained model's weights. This makes the fine-tuning process much more parameter-efficient.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA also reduces the memory footprint during training. This is particularly beneficial when working with very large models that would otherwise require substantial computational resources.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: With fewer parameters to update, the training process becomes faster. This can lead to quicker iterations and more rapid experimentation, which is valuable in research and development settings.\\n\\n4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The reduction in computational and memory requirements translates to lower costs for training and deploying models. This makes it more feasible for organizations with limited resources to leverage large language models.\\n\\n5. **Maintaining Performance**: Despite the reduction in parameters, LoRA has been shown to maintain or even improve the performance of the fine-tuned models. This means that the efficiency gains do not come at the cost of model accuracy or effectiveness.\\n\\n6. **Flexibility**: LoRA can be applied to various types of neural network architectures and is not limited to a specific model type. This makes it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.\\n\\n7. **Scalability**: The approach is scalable and can be applied to models of different sizes, making it suitable for both small and large-scale machine learning projects.\\n\\nOverall, LoRA provides a more efficient and cost-effective way to fine-tune large language models without compromising on performance, making it a valuable technique in the field of machine learning.\",\n",
