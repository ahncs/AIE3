            "content='LangChain is a framework specifically designed for developing applications that are powered by large language models (LLMs). It is particularly useful for tasks that require not only the generation of text but also the integration of LLMs with various data sources and environments to create more complex and functional applications.\\n\\nThe framework provides tools and abstractions that help developers to:\\n\\n1. **Connect with Data Sources**: LangChain allows LLMs to interface with a wide range of data sources such as APIs, databases, and other external information repositories.\\n\\n2. **Chain Operations**: It supports the chaining of multiple LLM calls and operations to perform more sophisticated tasks. This can include preprocessing inputs, managing context between calls, and postprocessing outputs.\\n\\n3. **Enhance LLM Capabilities**: By integrating with other systems and data, LangChain can help extend the capabilities of LLMs beyond simple text generation to include functionalities like information retrieval, data manipulation, and interaction with external systems.\\n\\n4. **Build Complex Pipelines**: Developers can create complex pipelines that leverage the strengths of LLMs in combination with other computational tools and resources.\\n\\nIn essence, LangChain aims to make it easier to build robust, versatile, and data-aware applications that take full advantage of the powerful capabilities of large language models.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 259, 'prompt_tokens': 22, 'total_tokens': 281}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_319be4768e', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-36e50b95-c738-4b92-a7b4-68811e9895be-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 22, 'output_tokens': 259, 'total_tokens': 281}\n"
